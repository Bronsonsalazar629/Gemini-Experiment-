  "explanation": "Causal graph analysis (template-based):\n\nIdentified 7 causal relationships in the clinical data.\n\nKey pathways from race to referral:\n- age \u2192 referral\n- age \u2192 chronic_conditions\n- race \u2192 referral\n- race \u2192 insurance_type\n- creatinine_level \u2192 referral\n\nThis graph represents potential bias propagation routes that should be examined for fairness violations."
